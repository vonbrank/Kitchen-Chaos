Extra best practices in Unity Engine:

+ Better organized Game Objects layout in Unity scenes.
+ Better organized structure of the project assets files.
+ Register event handlers in `OnEnable` method and deregister them in `OnDisable` method to elegantly avoid memory leaks.
+ Simplify singleton implementation with generic types.
+ Implement timers with Unity Coroutine.
+ And more...
