Extra best practices in Unity Engine:

+ Better organized Game Objects structure in Unity scenes.
+ Better organized folders structure in Unity assets directory.
+ Register event handlers in `OnEnable` method and deregister them in `OnDisable` method to elegantly avoid memory leaks.
+ Simplify singleton implementation with generic types.
+ Implement timers with Unity Coroutine.
+ Better remote procedure calls logic in some particular cases (e.g., stove counters, cutting counters).
+ And more...
